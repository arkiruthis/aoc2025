# Advent of Code 2025

A temporary repository for taking part in [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025), mostly for fun! 🎄

This project is written in **C++**.

## Quick Start

To build and run a solution (e.g., Day 1):

```bash
./compile.sh aoc1.cpp
./main
```

The `compile.sh` script compiles any C++ source file to `./main` using C++20 standard.
